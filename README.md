# CollegeSaathi
The App that controlls everything in College. 
Divided into multiple microservices, it provides all the basic needs that a college system required.
1. QR Based Attendance System : Teacher can generate a qr (on basis of there class) and student will scan it for getting the attendance of the class. [Student needs to be in the college campus and part of the class for successful scan)
2. Admins can add teachers and students. They can add the classes of the teacher.
3. Student can log into their account using ID no. They can update details, fetch result card of the last semester and basically everything that a student need to access.

Plans for Future: 
1. Library Service
2. Exam Enrollment

There can be lots of features in a college app. The app aims to comepelete secure digitalization of the events/ members of the college.

Note : This just a demo which I create this the picture of my college in mind.
